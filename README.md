Predictive model trained on EHR data to triage insurance denials

Machine learning is underutilized in the healthcare provider space due to data inaccessibility despite large amounts of available data.
This project addresses data silos, uses techniques to transform data into machine readable forms, and creates novel features to train a predictive model that helps hospital physician advisors triage inappropriate insurance denials of hospital admissions.
